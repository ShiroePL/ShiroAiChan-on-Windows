### Introducing My Anime Waifu Assistant: ShiroAi-chan üå∏

Ever dreamt of having your own AI-powered anime girl? With the power of [ChatGPT API], now anyone can! Meet ShiroAi-chan, my personal AI assistant who can write and even speak in an adorable voice.

### What's in This Repo?
The code for ShiroAi-chan is split across three repositories for different platforms:
1. [Streamlit repo] - The web version, built using [Streamlit].
2. [Desktop repo] - The desktop version featuring a Tkinter-based GUI.
3. [Wearos repo] - The mobile version, optimized for WearOS watches. This version runs on [FastAPI] inside a Docker container. (This version is most personalized, as I was focused on my Galaxy Watch 4)

### Configuration and Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To try ShiroAi-chan on your own, this repository will actually not be neccesery because this code is shared in all 3 versions, so you need to choose which version you want, and go to that repository.
